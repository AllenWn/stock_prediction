## Quick Start
To run this project, MATLAB installation is required with the latest Statistical and Machine Learning Toolbox.

### Data Processing
1. Place your stock data files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run `scripts/data_loader.m` to load the data.
3. Execute `scripts/data_preprocessor.m` to prepare the data for modeling.

### Model Training and Prediction
1. Execute `scripts/predictive_model.m` to start training the models.
2. Upon completion, prediction results will be saved in the `results/prediction_outputs/` directory.

## Configuration and Dependencies
- MATLAB R202X
- Statistical and Machine Learning Toolbox
